# Ruby skills evaluation

I was asked these few exercises as a skills evaluation for a potential employer. I'll leave it here for access to any other person interested to check my ruby and coding skills.
It took me arround 3 hours to answer these few questions. I clearly developed this while being connected to the internet, and man I used it. But I don't consider a "skill" to know any API by heart. I'll chat about this with pleasure.

## Question 1
Given 2 database tables :

table students:
    | id | name | address |

table applications:
    | id | student_id | score |

Write a query to list the number of applications each student has. Report 0 for students with no applications. List students first by number of applications, then alphabetically by name.

## Question 2
Write a program that reads a CSV file with information about different regular polygons (all sides equal), and circles. Each row of the file contains the name of the polygon and its side length, in order. Acceptable polygons include:
- triangle
- square
- pentagon
Note also that the shape "circle" should be accepted. Of course, a circle has no side length; instead, the dimension refers to its radius.
Here is an example CSV file:
triangle,3.5
circle,2
Given the input above, your program should output:
A triangle with side length 3.5 u has a perimeter of 10.5 u and an area of 5.30 u^2
A circle with radius 2 u has a perimeter of 12.57 u and an area of 12.57 u^2
Please write your solution using classes and objects as appropriate.

## Question 3
Given a raw string of html with no formatting like:
<html><body><div><a></a></div></body></html>

Write a program to produce the following output:
<html>
  <body>
    <div>
      <a>
      </a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

If the html is not valid (ie, there are mismatched or missing tags), print an error. Thus, the following two strings should produce errors:
<html><body><div></a></body></html>
<html><body><div><a></div></a>
Read in strings from stdin.  Return a non zero exit code on error.

## Question 4
For the array of letters (a, b, c, d, e, f), write a **recursive** function that outputs the following structure:

<a>

 <b>

  <c>

   <d>

    <e>

     <f>

     </f>

    </e>

   </d>

  </c>

 </b>

</a>
